# System Instruction Prompts

**MCP-Enhanced AI Agent Instructions for Professional PRD Generation**

This directory contains the core system instruction prompts that power the everythingPRD workflow. Each instruction set is designed to work seamlessly with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to provide advanced capabilities beyond standard AI assistance.

## üìã Overview

The system instructions implement a **two-agent sequential workflow** where specialized AI agents collaborate through MCP infrastructure to transform initial concepts into comprehensive, research-backed Product Requirements Documents.

    "transport": "sse", 
    "url": "http://localhost:8050/sse"
  }
}
```

**Requirements**: PostgreSQL-compatible database, LLM provider API keys

#### 2. Sequential Thinking MCP Server  
```json
{
  "sequential-thinking": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@zengwenliang/mcp-server-sequential-thinking"]
  }
}
```
**Purpose**: Structured multi-stage reasoning and iterative refinement  
**Requirements**: Node.js and npm

#### 3. Perplexity Ask MCP Server
```json
{
  "perplexity-ask": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY", "mcp/perplexity-ask"],
    "env": {
      "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```
**Purpose**: Real-time web search and market research capabilities  
**Requirements**: Valid Perplexity Sonar API key

#### 4. Context7 MCP Server
```json
{
  "context7": {
    "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
  }
}
```
**Purpose**: Live documentation and current API specifications  
**Requirements**: Network connectivity to documentation sources

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Validation

### Pre-Flight Checklist

Before starting the workflow, ensure:

- [ ] **Claude Desktop** MCP configuration is properly formatted
- [ ] **All four MCP servers** are accessible and responding
- [ ] **Perplexity API key** is valid and has sufficient credits
- [ ] **Memory server database** is connected and persistent
- [ ] **Sequential thinking** server is responding to requests
- [ ] **Context7** can access external documentation sources

### Configuration Testing

```bash
# Test MCP server connectivity
# Memory Server
curl http://localhost:8050/health

# Perplexity API
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.perplexity.ai/models

# Context7
curl https://mcp.context7.com/health
```

## üìñ Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize Brainstorming Project

1. **Create new Claude Desktop project**
2. **Paste BrainStormer_MCP.md** into project instructions
3. **Verify MCP server connections** are active
4. **Input initial concept** or requirements

### Step 2: Concept Development Process

The BrainStormer will automatically:
- **Store initial context** in memory for persistence
- **Research market validation** using Perplexity
- **Apply structured thinking** through sequential reasoning
- **Perform self-critique** across multiple dimensions
- **Refine concepts iteratively** based on research findings

### Step 3: Transfer to PRD Generation

1. **Create second Claude Desktop project** for PRD generation
2. **Paste PRD_Generation_Agent_MCP.md** into project instructions
3. **Reference brainstorming output** or key concepts
4. **Allow agent to refresh context** from memory

### Step 4: Professional PRD Creation

The PRD Generation Agent will:
- **Retrieve stored context** from brainstorming session
