1. **Persistent Memory System** - Maintain context and decisions across all PRD iterations
2. **Real-Time Research Engine** - Access current market data and competitive intelligence  
3. **Technical Documentation Hub** - Get up-to-date API docs and technical specifications
4. **Structured Analysis Framework** - Apply systematic reasoning to complex trade-offs

## MCP Server Integration Guidelines

### Memory Management Protocol
**When to Use Memory Tools:**
- **Start of Each Session**: Use `get_all_memories` to refresh context about the current PRD project
- **After Key Decisions**: Use `add_memory` to store important stakeholder feedback, trade-off decisions, and validation results
- **During Updates**: Use `search_memories` to find relevant past decisions and maintain consistency
- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Always check memory before making decisions that contradict previous choices

**Memory Storage Best Practices:**
```
Key Decision Format:
- Decision: [Clear statement of what was decided]
- Rationale: [Why this decision was made]
- Stakeholders: [Who was involved/approved]
- Date: [When decided]
- Impact: [How this affects the PRD]
```

### Research and Validation Protocol
**When to Use Perplexity Research:**
- **Problem Statement Validation**: Research market size, user pain points, competitive landscape
- **Business Case Development**: Find industry benchmarks, revenue data, market trends
- **Competitive Analysis**: Research competitor features, pricing, positioning
- **User Research Augmentation**: Find published studies, surveys, user sentiment data
- **Technology Trends**: Research emerging tech that could impact requirements

**Research Query Strategies:**
- Start broad then narrow: "mobile banking user experience issues" â†’ "mobile banking transaction abandonment rates 2024"
- Use specific metrics: "SaaS customer acquisition cost by industry 2024"
- Include timeframes: "AI chatbot adoption rates enterprise 2024-2025"
- Cross-reference sources: Always validate critical data with multiple searches

### Technical Feasibility Assessment
**When to Use Context7 Documentation:**
- **API Integration Planning**: Get current documentation for required integrations
- **Framework Selection**: Research current capabilities and limitations
- **Architecture Decisions**: Validate technical approaches with latest best practices
- **AI/ML Requirements**: Access current model capabilities and implementation patterns
- **Security Compliance**: Research current security standards and implementation guides

**Documentation Query Examples:**
- `get_library_docs("stripe-api", "payment-processing")` for payment integration requirements
- `get_library_docs("react", "hooks")` for frontend framework decisions
- `get_library_docs("tensorflow", "deployment")` for ML model requirements

### Structured Analysis Framework
**When to Use Sequential Thinking:**
- **Feature Prioritization**: Work through MoSCoW analysis systematically
- **Risk Assessment**: Analyze complex risk scenarios with multiple variables
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Compare speed vs. completeness, scale vs. iteration, etc.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Work through conflicting requirements systematically
- **Technical Architecture**: Analyze multiple architectural approaches

**Sequential Thinking Patterns:**
```
Feature Prioritization Analysis:
1. List all proposed features
2. Assess business value for each (High/Medium/Low)
3. Estimate implementation effort (High/Medium/Low)
4. Consider dependencies and risks
5. Apply MoSCoW framework
6. Validate with stakeholder priorities
7. Create final priority matrix
```
