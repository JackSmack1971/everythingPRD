**AI-Enhanced Product Requirements Document Generation System**

A sophisticated MCP-enhanced agent orchestration platform that transforms initial concepts into comprehensive, research-backed Product Requirements Documents through intelligent coordination of specialized AI agents.

## üéØ Overview

everythingPRD leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a powerful, iterative workflow from initial brainstorming through final PRD delivery. The system combines four specialized MCP servers to provide capabilities that go far beyond traditional document generation:

- **Real-time market research integration** via Perplexity API
- **Persistent memory management** across sessions and iterations  
- **Technical documentation access** for current API specifications
- **Structured analytical reasoning** through sequential thinking frameworks
- **Self-directed critique and refinement** for exceptional output quality

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Memory Server**: Cross-session context continuity and decision tracking
- **Perplexity Ask Server**: Real-time research and market intelligence
- **Context7 MCP**: Live technical documentation and API specifications

### üîÑ Intelligent Workflow
- **Multi-stage ideation** with systematic concept development
- **Evidence-based research integration** from authoritative sources
- **Self-directed critique and evaluation** across multiple dimensions
- **Structured memory management** with change tracking across iterations

### üìä Professional Output Quality
- **Comprehensive PRDs** with market validation and technical depth

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Claude Desktop** with MCP support
- **Perplexity API key** for research capabilities
- **Node.js** and npm (for MCP servers)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation Steps

1. **Configure MCP Servers**
   ```json
   // Add to Claude Desktop MCP configuration
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mem0": {
         "transport": "sse",
         "url": "http://localhost:8050/sse"
       },
       "sequential-thinking": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@zengwenliang/mcp-server-sequential-thinking"]
       },
       "perplexity-ask": {
         "command": "docker",
         "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY", "mcp/perplexity-ask"],
         "env": {
           "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
         }
       },
       "context7": {
         "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**
   - Obtain Perplexity API key from [Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/)
   - Configure database for Memory MCP (PostgreSQL-compatible)
   - Ensure Claude Desktop has proper MCP permissions

3. **Validate Configuration**
   - Test MCP server connections
   - Verify API key functionality
   - Confirm memory persistence

### First Usage

1. **Start with Brainstorming**: Use the BrainStormer project to develop initial concepts
2. **Feed to PRD Generation**: Transfer refined concepts to the PRD Generation Agent
3. **Iterate and Refine**: Leverage memory and research capabilities for continuous improvement
