## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Claude Desktop** with MCP support ([Download](https://claude.ai/desktop))
- **Perplexity API key** for research capabilities ([Get API Key](https://docs.perplexity.ai/))
- **Node.js** (v18+) and npm (for MCP servers)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)
- **PostgreSQL-compatible database** (for Memory MCP - Supabase recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. **Configure MCP Servers**
   
   Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mem0": {
         "transport": "sse",
         "url": "http://localhost:8050/sse"
       },
       "sequential-thinking": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@zengwenliang/mcp-server-sequential-thinking"]
       },
       "perplexity-ask": {
         "command": "docker",
         "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY", "mcp/perplexity-ask"],
         "env": {
           "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
         }
       },
       "context7": {
         "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**
   - Obtain Perplexity API key from [Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/)
   - Configure database for Memory MCP (PostgreSQL-compatible)
   - Ensure Claude Desktop has proper MCP permissions

3. **Validate Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Test Memory Server
   curl http://localhost:8050/health
   
   # Test Perplexity API
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.perplexity.ai/models
   
   # Test Context7
   curl https://mcp.context7.com/health
   ```

### Optimal Input Specification

To maximize output quality from the BrainStormer agent, structure your input with these essential elements:

#### **Tier 1: Essential Information (Minimum Viable)**
- **Primary Objective**: What specific business/personal goal are you trying to achieve?
- **Core Problem**: What problem are you solving, and for whom?
- **Key Constraints**: Budget, timeline, regulatory, or technical limitations
- **Success Metrics**: How will you measure success?

#### **Tier 2: Enhanced Input (Recommended)**
- **Target Audience**: Specific user personas and their characteristics
- **Market Scope**: Geographic boundaries, market size, competitive landscape
- **Key Stakeholders**: Decision makers, users, influencers, and their priorities
- **Output Requirements**: Document type, audience, detail level, format preferences

#### **Tier 3: Optimal Input (Maximum Quality)**
- **Research Direction**: Current knowledge, information gaps, assumptions to test
- **Technical Requirements**: Specific technologies, integrations, capabilities needed
- **Process Preferences**: Iteration style, research depth, risk tolerance
- **Existing Context**: Previous work, past learnings, organizational context

#### **Example Optimal Input:**
```
I'm developing a B2B invoice automation platform targeting mid-market companies 
(50-500 employees) in professional services. The core problem is that these 
companies spend 8-12 hours weekly on manual invoice processing, leading to 
cash flow delays and errors.

Primary objective: Build an MVP that reduces invoice processing time by 70% 
and integrates with QuickBooks and Xero. Budget: $75K, 8-month timeline. 
Must handle 1000+ invoices/month and achieve SOC2 compliance for enterprise sales.

Key stakeholders: CFOs (decision makers), accounting managers (primary users), 
IT directors (integration concerns). Success metrics: 50 paying customers by 
month 12, $500K ARR.

Research needed: Validate market size for mid-market professional services, 
analyze competitors (Bill.com, MindBridge AI), understand compliance requirements. 
Current assumption: companies will pay $200-500/month for 70% time savings.

Output needed: Comprehensive PRD for technical team with go-to-market strategy 
section for executives. 3-4 iteration rounds preferred with focus on technical 
feasibility and competitive positioning.
```

#### **Input Quality Guidelines**
‚úÖ **Specific and Measurable**: "Increase customer retention by 15%" vs. "improve customer experience"  
‚úÖ **Context-Rich**: Explains the WHY behind objectives and constraints  
‚úÖ **Assumption-Explicit**: States what you believe to be true but want validated  
‚úÖ **Stakeholder-Aware**: Identifies all parties affected by decisions  
‚úÖ **Outcome-Focused**: Describes desired end state and success criteria  

‚ùå **Avoid**: Vague requests, solution-first thinking, constraint-free descriptions, single perspectives
